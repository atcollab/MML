# RELEASE Location of external products

# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependencies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here

#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

# For the following definitions
# (MATLABDIR + SCILABDIR, that is)
# different methods can be used [we use
# XXX as a placeholder which could be any
# of MATLABDIR or SCILABDIR]:
#
# 1) if XXX is defined then it overrides
#    everything else
# 2) Architecture specific paths can be
#    given (e.g., because matlab for solaris
#    is installed in a different place from
#    matlab for linux on a file server):
#
#    XXX_<epics_host_arch> is used if not empty
#    else XXX_DEFAULT is used.
#
# Examples:
#
# MATLABDIR = /a/b/c  (use same MATLABDIR for everything)
#
# SCILABDIR_win32-x86 = C:\SCILAB           (use this on WIN32)
# SCILABDIR_DEFAULT   = /usr/lib/scilab-4.1 (use for everything else)

##########################################
# Tell us where SCILAB is installed (only
# needed if MAKEFOR != MATLAB [in CONFIG])

#SCILABDIR=/usr/lib/scilab-4.1

#you can also use EPICS_HOST_ARCH - specific
#paths -- see above

##########################################
# Tell us where MATLAB is installed (only
# needed if MAKEFOR=MATLAB [in CONFIG])

MATLABDIR=/home/als/alsbase/matlab_2007a

#you can also use EPICS_HOST_ARCH - specific
#paths -- see above

# Finally, we need to know what compiler
# you use to get the correct matlab libmx and
# libmex versions. This points to the compiler
# specific subdir (example for MS visual C / matlab R2006b)
# ONLY NEEDED ON WINDOZE (setting is ignored on
# other platforms) where the 'libmex.lib' and
# 'libmx.lib' are found.

#MATLIB_SUBDIR=win32/microsoft/msvc70

#         SLAC specific paths are optionally 
#         included from RELEASE-SLAC; the file
#         (not included in the distribution) is used
#         by me (TS) for development + testing)
#         I use this setup so that I can leave
#         this RELEASE template alone...

# convertRelease.pl is too stupid to recognize '-include'
# so we use this ugly trick:
ifndef EPICS_BASE
# if we have no definition of EPICS_BASE; hence
# there must be RELEASE-SLAC file
include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE-SLAC
else
# otherwise it's optional but convertRelease.pl will
# find the 'include' line above and use it to
# generate CONFIG_APP_INCLUDE
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE-SLAC
