Using <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN>
</H2>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> consists of a set of shared libraries which in turn reference
other shared libraries (most notably the channel access client libraries
from EPICS BASE). It is of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">crucial importance</SPAN> that the operating
system locates the correct versions at <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">run-time</SPAN> (i.e. the same versions
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> was <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">linked</SPAN> against). Otherwise, the run-time linker/loader
could fail to load the required objects -- leaving the user (expecially
in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN>) at the prompt with obscure error messages.

<P>
Under <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">linux</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">solaris</SPAN>, the <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> environment
variable or the <TT>ld.so.conf / ldconfig</TT> facility are used to point
to the executable shared libraries (located in <TT>lib/&lt;arch&gt;</TT>).
If using a binary distribution, the <TT>PATH</TT> variable also should point
to <TT>bin/&lt;arch&gt;</TT> so that the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CA repeater</SPAN> executable is found.
If you build from source using your own EPICS base installation then
we assume that locating the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CA repeater</SPAN> has already been taken
care of.

<P>
Under <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">win32</SPAN>, the <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable must point to the
correct EPICS BASE and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> DLLs (located in <TT>bin/&lt;arch&gt;</TT>).

<P>
Note that the paths to the correct EPICS BASE and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> shared libraries
must be set up <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">prior</SPAN> to starting the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scilab</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN> application.
It is usually not possible to change the system search
path from within an application.

<P>
Possible problems could occur because

<UL>
<LI>third party setup scripts modify <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / PATH</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>your EPICS BASE was not built with shared libraries but shared libraries
of a different release are found somewhere.
</LI>
<LI>a ``innocent-looking'' directory present in <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>
before EPICS BASE actually contains shared libraries of an older release.
</LI>
<LI>Note that the system search path is <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN> identical with the
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN> path -- changing the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN> path (from withing <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN>)
has no influence on the system search path.
</LI>
</UL>

Using <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> with <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scilab</SPAN></A>

Set up the shared library search path (as described above) and start
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scilab</SPAN>. Run the <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN>.sce</TT> script which was generated by the build process
(<TT>&lt;<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN>-top&gt;/bin/&lt;arch&gt;/<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN>.sce</TT>) to load the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> interface.
The script also adds to the <TT>%helps</TT> variable making on-line
help available.

<P>
The script can be installed at any convenient location -- the lines
setting up the <TT>%helps</TT> path need to be adapted in this case.

<P>
It is also possible to permanently link <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labCA</SPAN> to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scilab</SPAN>. Consult
the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scilab</SPAN> documentation for more information.

Every entry point / <TT>lcaXXX</TT> routine

Note that this is in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">addition</SPAN>
to setting the system library search path which must be performed prior
to starting <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">matlab</SPAN> (see previous section).
All necessary objects and libraries are transparently loaded simply
by invoking any of the entry point routines. Note that on-line help
files are also installed to be located automatically.
