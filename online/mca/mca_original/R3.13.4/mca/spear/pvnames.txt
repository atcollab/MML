Orbit PV names

    Folks,

In response to the overwhelming demand (hi Jeff!) to create some "safe"
process variables for testing channel access routines, I have created the
following PVs

spr:v4g11/am      spr:t4c12/ac
spr:v4g12/am      spr:t4c23/ac
spr:v4g13/am      spr:t4c24/ac
spr:v4g14/am      spr:t4e1/ac
spr:v4g15/am      spr:t4e5/ac
spr:v4g16/am      spr:t4q1e5/ac
spr:v4g17/am      spr:t4q1e6/ac
spr:v4g18/am      spr:t4q2e6/ac
spr:v4g19/am      spr:t4q2e9/ac
spr:v4g20/am      spr:t4q2e10/ac


I apologize for the ugly names, but I didn't invent the SPEAR realtime
database.  The left column PVs are "inputs".  They are 10 channels from the
same type of CAMAC module (a SAM or "smart analog module") that reads the
SPEAR trim power supplies.  The right column PVs are "outputs".  They are
10 channels from the same type of CAMAC module (a Transiac DAC) that drives
the SPEAR trim supplies.  The output of each row is looped back to the
corresponding input.  The data acquisition is handled by the standard SPEAR
control system process XCAMAC and so using these variables is a realistic test
of channel access control of SPEAR.  Please note that the SAMs take ~800ms to
digitize an input because they do a lot of averaging to eliminate common mode
interference.

Have fun and as usual let me know what breaks.
